  "description" : "This script creates LaTex images on the fly with KLatexFormula. e. g. $x^2$ or $[22] x^2$ to create larger images. \nThe images are created once and reused as long as the formula does not change. If you changed the preamble you have to clean the tmp folder to regenerate the images. \nDon't make it too complicated, this size works though: $[33] \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{-\\frac{x^2}{a}}dx$\nHint: You might want to add the $-signs after writing the formula to prevent intermediate image generation."
