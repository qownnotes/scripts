  "description" : "Inbox is a complex script to organize data added from different devices and applications.\n\n<b>It's currently at beta stage, so using it for unrecoverable data is discouraged.</b>\n\nThe script processes files in inbox folder you set or whole note folder (depending on settings) as follows:\n- The script turns all .txt files and files with no extension to .md note with modification time in the file name.\n- If there's a word that starts with a '@' (configurable) in file text, content of that file will be added to .md note named like that word. The content of .txt file with '@tag' in text will be added to 'tag.md' file.\n- Every URL in text file will be converted to markdown link, with web page favicon and title if possible.\n- Any web page, saved as .htm file with '_files' folder, will be converted to .md note.\n- Any image file placed to inbox folder will be moved to media folder. The script will put .md note with the in-line image instead.\n- Any other file placed to inbox folder will be moved to attachments folder. The script will put .md note with a link to the file instead. On Linux the file icon will be put before link.\n- (Inbox folder only) Text/link of file placed to sub-folder of inbox folder will be added to .md note named like the sub-folder. Everything put to 'topic' sub-folder will be added to 'topic.md' file.\n- (Linux only) The script will put thumbnail for .pdf file as a link to it.\n- (Linux only) The script will replace large in-line images with a smaller ones as a link to original ones.\n\n <a href=\"https://github.com/qownnotes/scripts/blob/master/inbox/workflow.md\">Workflow examples</a>
